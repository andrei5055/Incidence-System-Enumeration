   1033129 matrices were constructed in  1:07:32:51.85 sec,
        21 of them are transitive on the rows.
         0 matrices have no replicated blocks,
         0 of them are transitive on the rows.
   1380311 matrices were fully constructed.

        Using 64-bit program with no Assembly
        Main data storage format: "unsigned char"
        20 threads launched on row 4 (not waiting to finish mode)
        Solutions obtained by master are copied by the threads
