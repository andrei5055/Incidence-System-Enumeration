    155118 matrices were constructed in  1:18:35.59 sec,
        16 of them are transitive on the rows.
         0 matrices have no replicated blocks,
         0 of them are transitive on the rows.
    217359 matrices were fully constructed.

        Using 64-bit program with no Assembly
        Main data storage format: "unsigned char"
        20 threads launched on row 4 (not waiting to finish mode)
        Solutions obtained by master are copied by the threads
        Canonicity of partial constructed matrix was used
