         1 matrix was constructed in  0.36 sec,
         1 of them is transitive on the rows.
         1 matrix has no replicated blocks,
         1 of them is transitive on the rows.
         1 matrix was fully constructed.

Processing times are:
             user_time:  0.75 sec,
  kernel (system) time:  0.00 sec,


        Using 64-bit program with no Assembly
        Main data storage format: "unsigned char"
        20 threads launched on row 4 (not waiting to finish mode)
        Solutions obtained by master are copied by the threads
        Canonicity of partial constructed matrix was used
        Strong canonicity was not used
