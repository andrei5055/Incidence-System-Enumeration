         8 matrices were constructed in 13:28:39.76 sec,
         2 of them are transitive on the rows.
         8 matrices have no replicated blocks,
         2 of them are transitive on the rows.
         8 matrices were fully constructed.

Processing times are:
             user_time:  3:22:36:40.12 sec,
  kernel (system) time: 14:11.03 sec,


        Using 64-bit program with no Assembly
        Main data storage format: "unsigned char"
        25 threads launched on row 5 (not waiting to finish mode)
        Solutions obtained by master are copied by the threads
