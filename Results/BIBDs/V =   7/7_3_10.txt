     54613 matrices were constructed in  1.11 sec,
        14 of them are transitive on the rows.
         0 matrices have no replicated blocks,
         0 of them are transitive on the rows.
     82840 matrices were fully constructed.

Processing times are:
             user_time: 11.96 sec,
  kernel (system) time:  0.18 sec,


        Using 64-bit program with no Assembly
        Main data storage format: "unsigned char"
        20 threads launched on row 3 (not waiting to finish mode)
        Solutions obtained by master are copied by the threads
