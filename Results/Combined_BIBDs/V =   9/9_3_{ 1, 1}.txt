         3 matrices were constructed in  0.00 sec,
         1 of them is transitive on the rows.
         3 matrices have no replicated blocks,
         1 of them is transitive on the rows.
         6 matrices were fully constructed.

Processing times are:
             user_time:  0.00 sec,
  kernel (system) time:  0.00 sec,


        Using 64-bit program with no Assembly
        Main data storage format: "unsigned char"
        Single thread mode
        3-Condition on the elements was not used
        Canonicity of partial constructed matrix was used
        Strong canonicity was not used
        Super strong canonicity was not used
