Processing times are:
             user_time: 59:46.45 sec,
  kernel (system) time: 23.76 sec,


        Using 64-bit program with no Assembly
        Main data storage format: "unsigned char"
        20 threads launched on different rows # >= 4 (not waiting to finish mode)
        Solutions obtained by master are copied by the threads
