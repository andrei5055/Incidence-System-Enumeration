        43 matrices were constructed in  0.02 sec,
        23 of them are transitive on the rows.
         2 matrices have no replicated blocks,
         2 of them are transitive on the rows.
        62 matrices were fully constructed.

        Using 64-bit program with no Assembly
        Main data storage format: "unsigned char"
        15 threads launched on row 3 (not waiting to finish mode)
        Solutions obtained by master are copied by the threads
