        31 matrices constructed in  0.02
         1 matrix has no replicated blocks
        43 matrices were fully constructed

        Using  64 - bit program with  no Assembly
        Main data storage format: "unsigned char"
         2 threads launched on row 3 (not waiting to finish mode)
        Solutions obtained by master are copied by the threads
